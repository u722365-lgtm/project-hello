      "Needed a credible GTM plan and investor one-pager but was bouncing between ChatGPT, Google Docs, and Perplexity with no single export.",
    solution:
      "Used ShadowTalk /strategy and Mission Control: market sizing → channel plan → one-pager draft with cited research in one workspace.",

      "Client work required AI research but corporate ChatGPT accounts were blocked; needed instant access without training-data uncertainty.",
    solution:
      "Started on /chatbot anonymous tier, enabled E2EE chat, used deep research with citations and Stealth Vault for draft storage.",

      "Delivered cited brief without forcing a consumer OpenAI account; retained ShadowTalk for recurring client workflows.",

      "ShadowTalk language switcher (ur + en) plus multilingual chat for SOP drafts and customer reply templates.",
