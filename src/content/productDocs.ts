    a: "A multi-step agent runner at /missioncontrol — it plans tasks, calls tools, and pauses for your approval on sensitive actions before continuing.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the Personal ShadowTalk Model?",
    a: "A default “My ShadowTalk” profile that learns from your conversations (tone, preferences, recurring topics) and adds few-shot examples to prompts. Manage it at /personal-llm or Settings → Personalization. This is prompt-level learning, not full weight fine-tuning.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does offline mode work?",
    a: "Install a local model from Settings → Offline AI (SmolLM ~130MB or larger Gemma). When offline or when routing chooses local, replies run in your browser via WebGPU/WASM. Elite plan includes full offline login with cached credentials.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is my data private?",
    a: "We don't train foundation models on your chats. BYOK sends prompts to your provider. Stealth Vault and local inference keep sensitive work on-device when you enable those features. Read /privacy and /transparency for details.",
  },
  {
    q: "What are the free tier limits?",
    a: `Free includes all features with daily caps: ${FREE_TIER_MARKETING.messages}, ${FREE_TIER_MARKETING.images}, ${FREE_TIER_MARKETING.voice}, ${FREE_TIER_MARKETING.deepResearch}, plus limits on uploads, code gen, and web search. See /pricing for the full table.`,
  },
  {
    q: "How do I pay from Pakistan?",
    a: "International cards: /pricing via Stripe. Local methods (JazzCash, Easypaisa, bank transfer, USDT): /founder-access.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use ShadowTalk without signing in?",
    a: "Yes, when anonymous sign-in is enabled you get a guest session with stricter caps (10 chats, 3 images, 2 deep research). Link email from Profile to keep history.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do marketplace agents work?",
    a: "Browse /marketplace, click Run on an agent — you land on /chatbot?agent=id with that specialist's system prompt and tools wired in.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does ShadowTalk have an API?",
    a: "Yes — REST endpoints on ShadowTalk backend edge functions (chat, web-search, security scan, etc.). API keys are provisioned for Elite plans; see the API tab in these docs or /api.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is there a desktop app?",
    a: "Yes — Electron builds at /downloads, plus PWA install from any Chromium browser for a native-feeling shortcut.",
  },
  {
    q: "How is ShadowTalk different from ChatGPT?",
    a: "One workspace for chat, IDE, missions, research, browser, vault, and marketplace agents — with BYOK, offline, and approval-gated missions. Free tier unlocks all feature types with limits instead of hard paywalls.",
  },
  {
    q: "Who built ShadowTalk?",
    a: "Zain Ahmed Fahad Patel (Zain Ahmed), founder and lead architect, Karachi, Pakistan. Product since February 2024. Profile: /zain-ahmed-fahad-patel · About: /about.",
  },
  {
    q: "Where can I get help?",
    a: "/faq for quick answers, /help for the help center, /contact for support, /status for uptime. Ask in-chat: “what tools do you have?” or open /docs.",
